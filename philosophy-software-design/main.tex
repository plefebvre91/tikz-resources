      \begin{block}{Design Complexity}
        Complexity is anything related to the structure of a software that makes it hard to understand or modify. It can be defined as:
        \begin{equation*}
          C = \sum_{p} c_{p} \cdot t_{p}
        \end{equation*}
        Where $p$ is the number of components, $c_p$ the complexity of each component, et $t_p$ the fraction time accorded to it.
      \end{block}

      
      \begin{block}{Nature of complexity}
        \textbf{Depedencies} and \textbf{obscurity} causes complexity. It can be evaluated by questionning the 3 points:
        \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Change amplification}: amount of code affected by each design decision;
        \item \textbf{Cognitive load}: how much a developer need to know to complete a task;
        \item \textbf{Unknown unknows}: obviousness of which piece of code must be modified to complete a task.
        \end{itemize}
      \end{block}
      

      \begin{block}{Strategic vs. Tactical}
        \begin{sidefigure}

          \caption {Tactical programming make things work, quickly. Strategic programming invest time on design.}
        \end{sidefigure}
        At the beginning, a tactical approach to programming will make progress more quickly than a strategic approach. However, complexity accumulates more rapidly under the tactical approach, wich reduces productivity.

      \begin{block}{Deep vs. Shallow}

        \begin{figure}
          \centering
          \begin{subfigure}[t]{0.47\textwidth}
            \centering \scalebox{0.5}{\input{resources/shallow.tex}}
            \caption{Shallow module}
          \end{subfigure}
          \hfill
          \begin{subfigure}[t]{0.47\textwidth}
            \centering
            \centering \scalebox{0.4}{\input{resources/deep.tex}}
            \caption{Deep module}
          \end{subfigure}
        \end{figure}

        \textbf{Deep modules} have a simple interface and powerful functionnalities, \textbf{shallow modules} have complex interface, not much functionnality and hide does not hide complexity.
      \end{block}      
      \begin{block}{Together or Apart ?}
        Modules, classes or functions should be together if:
        \begin{itemize}
        \item information is shared,
        \item it simplifies interface,
        \item it avoids ressources duplication.
        \end{itemize}
        Keep a separation between specialized and general entities.
      \end{block}


      \begin{block}{Comments}
        Comments should capture information that was in the mind of the designer and could not be represented in the code.
      \end{block}
